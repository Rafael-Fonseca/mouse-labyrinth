#Mouse-Labyrinth

## About
This work was carried out to be delivered as the semester work of the discipline Artificial Intelligence.

Basically the algorithm should be able to find an output given a maze and save the way to future uses.

## What I learned?
First I learned how to use the native python turtle library, to draw on the screen.

Then I learned how to structure data in a tree form, binary and non-binary.

After that I learned a lot about the functional programming paradigm and mixed a bit of it in my code, basically the code started to have a lot of recursion.

After all I learned about search algorithms for the best choice

### Dependencies
Python 3.7 or superior, should work in previous versions as well, but I can not guarantee
### How to execute?
Just run the code by main.py and enjoy how Donatello get out of the maze.
